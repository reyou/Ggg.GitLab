# Job is going to be created only when pipeline has been scheduled or 
# runs for a master branch, and only if kubernetes service is active 
# in the project.

job:
  only:
    refs:
      - master
      - schedules
    kubernetes: active

# Examples of using variables expressions:

deploy:
  script: cap staging deploy
  only:
    refs:
      - branches
    variables:
      - $RELEASE == "staging"
      - $STAGING

# Another use case is exluding jobs depending on a commit message (added in 11.0):

end-to-end:
  script: rake test:end-to-end
  except:
    variables:
      - $CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE =~ /skip-end-to-end-tests/
