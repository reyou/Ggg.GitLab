# For example, to enable per-branch caching:

cache:
  key: "$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
  paths:
    - binaries/

# If you use Windows Batch to run your shell scripts you need to replace $ with %:
# normally below needs to be called "cache", but we cannot have duplicate
# keys in YAML
cache2:
  key: "%CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG%"
  paths:
    - binaries/

# Set untracked: true to cache all files that are untracked in your Git repository:

rspec:
  script: test
  cache:
    untracked: true

# Cache all Git untracked files and files in binaries:

rspec2:
  script: test
  cache:
    untracked: true
    paths:
      - binaries/
