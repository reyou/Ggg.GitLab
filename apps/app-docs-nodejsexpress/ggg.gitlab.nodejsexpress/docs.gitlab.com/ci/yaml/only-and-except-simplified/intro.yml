# In the example below, job will run only for refs 
# that start with issue-, whereas all branches will be skipped:

job:
  # use regexp
  only:
    - /^issue-.*$/
  # use special keyword
  except:
    - branches

# In this example, job will run only for refs that are tagged, or 
# if a build is explicitly requested via an API trigger 
# or a Pipeline Schedule:

job2:
  # use special keywords
  only:
    - tags
    - triggers
    - schedules

# The repository path can be used to have jobs executed only for 
# the parent repository and not forks:
# The example will run job for all branches on gitlab-org/gitlab-ce, except master.

job3:
  only:
    - branches@gitlab-org/gitlab-ce
  except:
    - master@gitlab-org/gitlab-ce
